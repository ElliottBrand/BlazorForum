## PROJECT OPEN DISCUSSIONS

* Open discussions about the following issues, TODOs, etc. can be found here: https://blazorforums.net/category/11/BlazorForum-Development

## TODO

* ** TESTS need written **

* Admin - Membership sections are under development.

* Build in ability to ensure topic/posts are approved before displaying them.

* Build in ability to flag posts and decide if flags should be their own db table, to log information like who flagged it, time, etc.

* Would like to be able to select a mode in the Admin area that determines if the front end forums will utilize support 
	forum type features (upvotes, codeblock editor, etc.) or a standard forum.

* Admin - Perhaps add ability to add Pages (ability to create pages to be used in the app) and Modules sections 
	(maybe some way to upload "plugin" type features), or decide if they should be created.

* Create a delete process for when a user delete's their profile to make sure it deletes all their posts, and any 
	child posts of topics they may have created.

* Move strings to a resources file, so it would be easier to eventually build in support for multiple cultures.

* Add spinner to load more, when loading more topics/posts

* It would be nice if this app could be updated with the click of a button at some point (when new app versions are 
	released on GitHub)
