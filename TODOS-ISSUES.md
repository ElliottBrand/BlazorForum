## PROJECT OPEN DISCUSSIONS

* Open discussions about the following issues, TODOs, etc. can be found here: https://blazorforums.net/category/11/BlazorForum-Development

## TODO

* ** TESTS need written **

* Build in ability to flag posts and decide if flags should be their own db table, to log information like who flagged it, time, etc.

* Build in ability to mark a post as an answer, when in a support forum mode.

* Admin - Perhaps add ability to add Pages (ability to create pages to be used in the app) and Modules sections (maybe some way to upload "plugin" type features), or decide if they should be created.

* Move strings to a resources file, so it would be easier to eventually build in support for multiple cultures.
